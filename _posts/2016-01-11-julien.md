2006-2016:
10 YEARS OF EXCLUSIVE TRAVELS

For
the past 10 years

We
have been traveling the world with iconic Châteaux owners to promote their
terroir, lifestyle and wines, organizing private events and initiatives.

Wine
is about people, trust and passion. Over the time, our clients requested us to
organize for them dedicated trips « into the vineyards » where they
could discover legendary wineries in style, improve their wine skills while
enjoying a good time with their friends.

Since then, W2 Travel Services (WTS)
became our travel division. First implemented in Bordeaux, we now open closed
doors in Italy, Spain and the USA. 2016 WTS catalogue is about 9 exclusive
packages that will drive you through the roads of fine wine pairing with the
best of local gastronomy while staying in memorable hotels.

Each location, each trip is designed for clients to enjoy the very best, according to the seasons,whatever their skills in wines. From 3 days to a week, there
is anything in between for you. 

Cheers & à bientôt 

Julien Angevin
